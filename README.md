# BubbleSortTest

This repository compares the implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm across multiple programming languages. Each implementation sorts an array of **1,000,000** numbers to evaluate performance and syntax differences.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to benchmark and analyze the Bubble Sort algorithm in various programming languages. The repository includes implementations in:

- **C**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **JavaScript**
- **Ruby**
- **Crystal**

Each implementation is designed to sort an array of 1 million elements, allowing for a direct comparison of execution time, code readability, and language-specific characteristics.
